I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://lagrange.oca.eu/fr/accueil-lagrange/">Laboratoire Lagrange</a> of <a href="https://univ-cotedazur.fr/">Université Côte d'Azur</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.cedric-richard.fr/">Cédric Richard</a>. I also work with CNRS Researher <a href="https://ricardoborsoi.github.io/">Ricardo Borsoi</a>.

Before that, I received my master degree in 2021 under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.jie-chen.com/">Jie Chen</a>, from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China, where I also received my bachelor degree in 2018.

My recent research interests focus on optimization on manifolds, change point detection, and hyperspectral image analysis. A formal biography as well as academic CV are available <a href="https://xiuheng-wang.github.io/assets/pdf/cv_xiuheng_wang.pdf">here</a>.
