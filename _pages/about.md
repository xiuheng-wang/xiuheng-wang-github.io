I am a PhD Candidate at <a href="https://lagrange.oca.eu/fr/accueil-lagrange/">Laboratoire Lagrange</a> of <a href="https://univ-cotedazur.fr/">Université Côte d'Azur</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.cedric-richard.fr/">Cédric Richard</a>.

Before coming to France, I received the B.E. degree in electronic and information engineering and the M.E. degree in signal and information processing from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China, in 2018 and 2021, respectively.

My recent research interests focus on optimization on manifolds, change point detection, and hyperspectral image analysis. More details are available under the publications tab.
